# PolyMarket_Mimic_Trader project notes

This repository is a Polymarket copy-trading bot (Python/asyncio) with:

- Configured runtime: `polymarket_copier/main.py`
- Trading logic modules:
  - `polymarket_copier/core/copier.py`
  - `polymarket_copier/core/monitor.py`
  - `polymarket_copier/core/risk_manager.py`
  - `polymarket_copier/core/portfolio.py`
  - `polymarket_copier/core/tracker.py`
- Exchange/API clients in `polymarket_copier/api/*`
- Config in `config.yaml` and secrets via `.env`

Testing and checks:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `pytest -v`
- `pytest -v -m "not integration"`
- `ruff check .`

Baseline architecture from initial inspection:
- `run_bot()` initializes config, logger, shared aiohttp session, risk manager, portfolio, clients.
- Tracker selects traders; monitor streams events and price ticks.
- CopyTrader validates events, applies risk checks, places/cancels mirrored orders.
- RiskManager enforces range-relative TP/SL and exposure/circuit-breaker rules.
- Portfolio manager persists open/closed positions in SQLite.

Notes:
- This repo already contains a `CLAUDE.md` with detailed operational rules.
- No `.codex`/agent files were present before this task.
